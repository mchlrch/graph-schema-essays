# graph-schema-essays

Playground for experiments with RDF graph schemas languages

## Introduction

The RDF space has several different languages related to schemas/ontologies. It should become simpler than it is today.

Improvements in the self-descriptiveness of graphs would enable better tooling for humans, making graphs more accessible, understandable and usable.

## Objectives

- Explore options on how to make datamodeling for RDF graphs straightforward
- Refine the nature of data models so that better tool support can be built on them
